1. TI Launchpad MSP430FR2476
Download Code Composer Studio from TI and use it to run the project. The main()
function for this hardware is set up to run mod_exp, and can run the falcon
code by having its appropriate function and set-up swapped in.

Code Composer Studio has a native cycle counter that can be reset by
double-clicking. To get cycle times, we can set a stop point just before the
function we're testing, reset the clock, and set another stop point just after.
We then record the listed cycle count.

This is necessary because there isn't support on the MSP430 for printing to
console.

Tests previously were done by comparing the verified printed code against code
compiled using the TI compiler built into CCS. A more accurate test would be to
compile the C code using the same compiler with the same parameters as the one
used to generate the initial pre-verified assembly.

2. SiFive HiFive Rev B RISC-V Board
RISC-V tests were done using Freedom Studio. These tests are more
straightforward because the RISC-V board supports printing to console. For
these tests, we use the development kit's API to set cycle timers, and print
them out to the console after running our test function.
