# Using Algebra Solver To Automate Certain Proofs

The idea has been explored in prior research. Seems applicable in our code base in several places.

## Congruence Proofs: 

There are some lemma that are about proving congruences, which can be automated using Grobner bases method via Singular.

```
ring r=integer,(m', m_0, k_1, p_1, x_i, y_0, a_0, p_1_lh, k_2, u_i, k_3, p_2, BASE),lp;
ideal I = m' * m_0 + 1 - k_1 * BASE,
    p_1 - x_i * y_0 - a_0,
    p_1_lh - p_1 - k_2 * BASE,
    u_i - p_1 * m' - k_3 * BASE,
    p_2 - u_i * m_0 - p_1_lh,
    BASE;
ideal G = groebner(I);
reduce(p_2, G);
```

```
ring r=integer,(BASE, BASE_INV, BASE_pow_i, BASE_INV_pow_i, n, A, x, y, A', x_i, x', k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4),lp;
ideal I = BASE * BASE_INV - 1 - k_1 * n,
	BASE_pow_i * BASE_INV_pow_i - 1 - k_2 * n,
	A - x * y * BASE_INV_pow_i - k_3 * n,
	A' * BASE - x_i * y - A - k_4 * n,
	x' - x - BASE_pow_i * x_i,
	n;
ideal G = groebner(I);
reduce(A' - x' * y * BASE_INV_pow_i * BASE_INV, G);
```

```
ring r=integer,(R, R_INV, rr, ar, a, aar, aaa, k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5, n),lp;
ideal I = R * R_INV - 1 - k_1 * n,
    rr - R * R - k_2 * n,
    ar - a * rr * R_INV - k_3 * n,
    aar - ar * ar * R_INV - k_4 * n,
    aaa - aar * a * R_INV - k_5 * n,
    n;
ideal G = groebner(I);
reduce(aaa - a * a * a, G);
```

## Equational Proofs: 

There are a few lemmas where we need to show some equality, given some equalities.
* Dafny is actually quite good at equational reasoning, even with non-linear math (surprisingly), which is at the core of these lemmas.
* Things gets complicated by recursive definitions that need to unfolded the right way, which Dafny can't effectively do. But the definitions only need to be unfolded constant number of times (1 in most cases). (Maybe setting the right fuel could already help here.)
* Grobner bases method also applies to equational reasoning, but does not help with the recursive definition unfolding.

[cmm_invarint_lemma_1](https://github.com/secure-foundations/veri-titan/blob/8b219fe6228ca42f3c0ce4bb99cd865c73541ae0/dfy_model/MMLemmas.dfy#L171)

[cmm_invarint_lemma_2](https://github.com/secure-foundations/veri-titan/blob/8b219fe6228ca42f3c0ce4bb99cd865c73541ae0/dfy_model/MMLemmas.dfy#L197)

[cmm_invarint_lemma_3](https://github.com/secure-foundations/veri-titan/blob/8b219fe6228ca42f3c0ce4bb99cd865c73541ae0/dfy_model/MMLemmas.dfy#L356)

## Big Int Induction Proofs: 

There are a few cases where we need to induct on the big integer
* The proofs themselves are quite intuitive (trivial), just some basic properties about the big ints in general.
* Proofs pretty much follow the same pattern, with induction on the sequence length. Recursive definitions needs to have controlled unfolding.

## Power() Proofs: 

Reasoning around `Power()` is a bit awkward.
* lemmas related to `Power()` needs to be proved
* these lemmas then need to be invoked explicitly

[this file](https://github.com/secure-foundations/veri-titan/blob/dafny-model-dev/dfy_model/powers.dfy) is all about proving some trivial lemmas about `Power()`. 

[this calc](https://github.com/secure-foundations/veri-titan/blob/2fd39315020e3c094b0cc1c1a0ccd315803128cb/dfy_model/RSALemmas.dfy#L280) is an example where the lemmas are being invoked.

# Related Works:

## [Certified Verification of Algebraic Properties on LowLevel Mathematical Constructs in Cryptographic Programs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3133956.3134076)

They develop a certified technique to verify low-level mathematical constructs in X25519. 
They translate algebraic specification of mathematical constructs into an algebraic problem.
Algebraic problems are solved by algebra system Singular.
Range problems are solved by  SMT solvers.
They certify the translation using Coq.

### Comments:
* the translation from assembly to bvCryptoLine is pushed into future work
* moreover, bvCryptoLine is supposedly close to assembly code, but it is unclear how large the gap is. would be interesting to know how well it translates from SIMD extensions for example. 
* the GrÃ¶bner Bases method is sound but incomplete
* the verification time is pretty long (131 hours), which seems high for interactive development

## [Signed Cryptographic Program Verification with Typed CryptoLine](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3319535.3354199)

### Comments:
* the extension from CryptoLine seems somewhat incremental
* the translation from GIMPLE to CryptoLine does not seem to be verified, so the TCB excludes C -> GIMPLE, but includes GIMPLE -> CryptoLine. The GIMPLE -> ASM part is still in the TCB.

## [Verifying Arithmetic in Cryptographic C Programs](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~bywang/papers/ase19.pdf)

### Comments:
* the diff between this work and Signed CryptoLine does not seem very significant. not sure how the LLVM -> CryptoLine differs greatly from GIMPLE -> CryptoLine.
* instead of a equivalence proof, the translation have a soundness theorem, which is a contribution
